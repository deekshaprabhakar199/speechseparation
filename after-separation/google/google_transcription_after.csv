mix6_separation_2|honor these type of men that do this every day they put themselves In Harm's Way that's what this movie
mix7_separation_1|I'm trying to be generous I think it was always hard for him because

mix9_separation_2|everybody thought it was going to do what it's done but actors are always kind of naive to that they always think that everything we do is going to last
mix10_separation_1|we not challenges I mean when I realize that my
mix10_separation_2|thing about having Jason and refectory those conversations about how those characters
mix11_separation_1|cared for so much more respect with James Morrison's it with the role and so I think both of you know all of us have this in common we judge we look up to the people who play
mix11_separation_2|so remember that very very clearly has to be true I remember think he'd have to give all your energy to table and but yeah there's no telling the truth
mix12_separation_1|I haven't totally personally but I'm definitely Ethel more aware
mix12_separation_2|Amica I haven't asked a question to things and I always loved

mix13_separation_2|you know everybody's welcoming very moment to show them to come in
mix14_separation_1|your favorite artist is mine and I would rather see them in a place like town hall and then at like Madison Square Garden so it's kind of for me a really big little old
mix14_separation_2|you're like almost going to roll over these people they don't have because it really is you figure out how to play this game as far as getting artists to come over to your team
mix15_separation_1|you see these two serious actors I'm see these guys that are trying to kill each other you know every every night we go
mix15_separation_2|when you go inside the background of the count has been admitted for whatever
mix16_separation_1|compassion every day I went to the Rosemary everyday I always was on meditation and talk too much
mix16_separation_2|talk that's more Luther esk things whether it's film whether it's been off balance but nothing's set in stone it's a it's a nice rumor to sort of explore but I'm not
mix17_separation_1|in a different way does the same things on the Hop they both teach each other to choose life to choose cold and to accept that even though happy
mix17_separation_2|Mischief my magic hi I'm Alex Maria represent Jim Jefferies him and Warren hit it off at a party and Warren said to stay in touch so which thank
mix18_separation_1|waiting for everybody is I think and that's what's so cool about shark nice reviews that we it's just like in a saltwater lake
mix18_separation_2|your room did he just ran by so I meet me suggested that the gym and he said his eyes lit up with
mix19_separation_1|it's very cheap and get it on the in the supermarket and I using words pensive
mix19_separation_2|because you don't keep that height of that intensity but as you walked off the job
mix20_separation_1|told them to go get on the Dinah Shore show so the many times that work together but I guess you down to his last ten dollars
mix20_separation_2|it takes place on upward a Newfoundland I mean what this cap relates to Opus hopes that could relate to warns bill
mix21_separation_1|we have an engine is envelope and send it into that so much and I think I might go after their achieved auditions and I think I'm though that the mirror maybe something and
mix21_separation_2|I found a job I tried open sender encrypts through to the microphone and then I go
mix22_separation_1|and think Arthur would do anything for her and really want to protect her
mix22_separation_2|or sometimes suffer from his Generals in Winter to you and where I can see both
mix23_separation_1|18 of the 17 wisdom in the 18 of the tickets

mix25_separation_1|hi needs not strongest but I just kind of things
mix25_separation_2|it offers hope people will tell you that is obviously that old adage a that mimicry is the highest form of flattery but jump It's a you know you're not making anything with that like
mix26_separation_1|
mix26_separation_2|entomology and some ghoul toys they wrote a character that was
mix27_separation_1|Jake relationships almost like three folds because it's like a boy and his dog it's two best friends but then it's also like two brothers
mix27_separation_2|it's going to be 65 which is of course is what we're on now and the zz2 would be engineered to the
mix28_separation_1|Anthem kick there for a second job which is stressful as an American
mix28_separation_2|the stuff and we were first it over and over and over and over and over again and
mix29_separation_1|it with shootings yeah everybody was kind of like a oh my God yeah so Callie

mix30_separation_1|the original director for the jazz dance and he came to see me and they're playing Our Song on Broadway and came backstage and said that he wanted me to be in this
mix30_separation_2|HBO look after your very well they care about their actors and the crew and so they've made it very easy for us
mix31_separation_1|I mean I watch the show growing up and I love this throughout my entire childhood
mix31_separation_2|officially on it it's too much responsibility so I'll say that I'm Aficionado at eating
mix32_separation_1|that's the amazing thing about those that and I've been very lucky I've shot in places when I've done stories especially
mix32_separation_2|his daughter works for me and the White House announced so there are connect the dots for sure
mix33_separation_1|the reason I like it is because we show
mix33_separation_2|traveling like I'd like to you know I like to drink whatever local beer
mix34_separation_1|it seems as if though only one can lead us most of traveling they both read it equally these families
mix34_separation_2|the really listens to rid of thing it just like he did and it was a couple of times I was able can I play with him so I can sync it with him so I'm making sure that I'm saying it correctly it's the same everything with such
mix35_separation_1|you know when I was a child watching my father's he started a program and and BC
mix35_separation_2|really really you know Slam in the charts and we were
mix36_separation_1|little so little mini fit starting and I'm like no no no I'm not ready for that yeah well I will definitely ask her about it

mix38_separation_1|physically leaving out of anything you'd be my date
mix38_separation_2|deal rap music is sampling and people who don't understand
mix39_separation_1|been in my want a lot so I know I didn't get as much time as I'd like to but I was just in New Zealand actually has a my first days off in a while
mix39_separation_2|watchable
mix40_separation_1|which is these days a lot of European directors are making movies in English because it was becoming International angry
mix40_separation_2|performers are members of the audience and Scholars and academics to ask the question who may have wrote
mix41_separation_1|she wants to go out to dinner party and having a wonderful time I'm looking at charm km next to me you have followed hours and I said I'm sorry
mix41_separation_2|drinking the personality of the litigant so that if the answers will land in front of me in this journey
mix42_separation_1|and I think it would be 30 years everything changed to the point where
mix42_separation_2|always that's always the weirdest thing about being a film is because the toilet there is someone waiting for you as you coming
mix43_separation_1|incredible generally speaking like the most normal guy
mix43_separation_2|it's wonderful very creative talented guy who
mix44_separation_1|if you come down to help you know and I think
mix44_separation_2|I'll be going to make it so that it can become a little more International penchant for you so all through
mix45_separation_1|so she did it's a walker tightrope so when's your head come medication she's very very able
mix45_separation_2|but then I remember visiting people in Bulgaria because he was present at the time the lines in the came back from Poland to sort of tell him I got my trip
mix46_separation_1|so completely different because people have been to the fabulous more person and a lot of women hate all this before we were removed to too
mix46_separation_2|LA but I had a very memorable trip from LA to Vancouver with my daughter loud vibrant so you know we took a road trip from LA
mix47_separation_1|if you don't expect too much the main thing I've done that to myself
mix47_separation_2|the Enduro and you can't really do that so I'm actually realize because you'll get hurt or someone will start
mix48_separation_1|professional competence and sulphurous is the for the first two years that we were working across the system
mix48_separation_2|short film before I was even no no people I really started I didn't even before I had an agent I didn't feel that I was incidents around our schools
mix49_separation_1|attachment the Tim Rice and that beautiful and will be part of the new vision to be
mix49_separation_2|it one of the most beautiful spots on the earth and that beach is absolutely gorgeous and we got there and it's breathtaking
mix50_separation_1|and now Marshall because you know that is so much a spotlight on it you know there is so much of negativity
mix50_separation_2|how can I help this Planet Hollywood is successful because the city needs it is a great venue for the young kids and young people to come out and join themselves
mix51_separation_1|that's okay the second one sets itself up and also if you're not a GI Joe fan you're also going to love this group meeting awesome action packed
mix51_separation_2|people out there that are the voice for the voiceless and the voiceless and defenseless animals that are out there because obviously people think
mix52_separation_1|or sports cars fastest cars for British guards in sure but there's some
mix52_separation_2|if you would like to take a small shovel puzzle to yeah that help that person
mix53_separation_1|they lost me I was like I do not have the abilities to be able to do this
mix53_separation_2|any team members or maybe brand or something like that yeah someone is willing to invent if it
mix54_separation_1|cell and we're going to Mexico we're going to Puerto Rico couple dated for leaks out and then
mix54_separation_2|I think this is something continue to store you know we didn't want to just do the same story again so we don't want to do the same story again with explosions
mix55_separation_1|which of the me out back and for some reason a window is there
mix55_separation_2|JavaScript and I think audiences do well have a recycle line store with experience potatoes
mix56_separation_1|being a piece of to the teachers but you know it's cool it's not it's not that different it back in
mix56_separation_2|like you know I was I didn't know what to say because I didn't believe in anything I was saying you know I had nothing
mix57_separation_1|well the actors really I mean we just sort of we had them they're always and she was just accessible ever
mix57_separation_2|I'm going to the women's Studies major I was doing my final project about fk4 about women
mix58_separation_1|and I guess it's a testament to us that they're still watching them so it's a symbiotic kind of relationship and I feel like we've been met with a lot of support and
mix58_separation_2|yeah well we're all graduating seniors so I'd like to say we're more mature love responsible girls young lady although when you see the oh
mix59_separation_1|
mix59_separation_2|and it was what's not true I do
mix60_separation_1|sorry because I couldn't really pronounce it like I couldn't do three because my voice hadn't
mix60_separation_2|that was almost my first memory was treating Countryside will know so we'll be happy
mix61_separation_1|I'm ready if that's like following me on Twitter Family Guy
mix61_separation_2|and parents and they said staying over there
mix62_separation_1|yeah I know I'll be there mostly you play down in age across the board and it's good because you have little like experience drawn
mix62_separation_2|stories geography is going Wiley yeah sorry for the donors that have brought his culture that is one of the most Innovative contributions that you can double culture I like it
mix63_separation_1|different character Elizabeth a of different movement over to be able to display the green 22 karat yeah
mix63_separation_2|if it still is really about and then there's a coming this very extreme forwards got stands between
mix64_separation_1|he was pate was punished more severely than any girl he wants to be set free and they won't so yeah it says he's completely the needs trapped and he makes another bad
mix64_separation_2|the Cheese Touch is worse than nuclear come here are and if you touch the cheese you're an outcast nobody will hang out with you and it's just awful I would never want to be touching
mix65_separation_1|you know that from rang true for so many people you know over three generations so they remember all those lines and poop and Rambo they remember all the action
mix65_separation_2|might be working but yeah that was awesome the season finale with last May and I was a huge part of that but it was for fun gig and maybe I'll come
mix66_separation_1|my daughter had 400 it was really hot but that said I think it was a very interesting challenge for them to write the finale with
mix66_separation_2|troll again he reopened all the theaters child s and made made England fun again and Rochester was kind of been at the helm of that in his
mix67_separation_1|one of the biggest motivation for doing something like this because because most people would say College of create believe in Savvy West End show that Wicked with it as well as you've got this great thing of is that way
mix67_separation_2|always been my first love and I feel like I'm really at a good age as well to come out with the type of music I want to make so
mix68_separation_1|then so I was an extra on a Jan-Michael Vincent movie
mix68_separation_2|I know my channel is in somewhat barrel-aged as of late as a
mix69_separation_1|but extremely caring too and I believe that's from his upbringing and what he's been through and how he's had to grow some bravery within himself to just keep himself go
mix69_separation_2|chains moving but they were always just me and that's what Reggie played by James came two years ago and asked me if I if I won't evil action is movies and
mix70_separation_1|I have met him that that time so I really want to check if you do members you know sorry I I remember when you were on that stage during the trailer launch I couldn't find my purse back
mix70_separation_2|and I think this is a piece of that Jim it's not by no means answered in this movie so it's you know it's not tragic it
mix71_separation_1|it wasn't me not that I'm ashamed of it it's just that poor woman who was all yet
mix71_separation_2|it was a few years ago and it was a pure accident because I anybody had mentioned in the movie so it was just to do
mix72_separation_1|listening to what
mix72_separation_2|I said we are just a day earlier
mix73_separation_1|so he starts picking up idea and it came up with this idea of a father overprotective father losing a sudden searching the ocean for his son
mix73_separation_2|which is what they put any woman and who is not what they believe to be considered for romantically which would be maybe because of your age or your way and I'm in the
mix74_separation_1|she is going to be like a pack of wolves I mean it was the worst cop
mix74_separation_2|the worry is one of The Originals
mix75_separation_1|but I think that's life life Journey at the hotel he ups and down Hold the End yes of course it sounds but what
mix75_separation_2|25 years ago you know and I was really spoiled because it was such a great experience I just thought everything was going to be like that
mix76_separation_1|it's exploring that as an actor it's going out through the performance and together with all these guys
mix76_separation_2|Raleigh convention I've done so it's exciting to be here I've never been to rallies ever for a convention and
mix77_separation_1|work toward the greater good and that's when would I think as much as this is so fiction and so entertainment
mix77_separation_2|well when I came here two years ago I think I ran my fastest of the year on this track so I think I'm going to run pretty fast
mix78_separation_1|because your lives are intertwined you interact
mix78_separation_2|at to give me the stock but in order for you guys to understand my
mix79_separation_1|different viewpoints of faith and yet I think ultimately everybody
mix79_separation_2|and I think women are saying that so you it's actually probably more useful to think of women
mix80_separation_1|and and I talked to actually talk this out with Millie gussie who was the casting director at
mix80_separation_2|that was one of the first time I could see myself acting something that I was not writing you know because I always you to do I like to be in
mix81_separation_1|interface goes if you go board set up there you know we tried lots of different ways and move
mix81_separation_2|the very interesting back story through your core
mix82_separation_1|it was just going to go on forever working working working and I wanted to just know who I was again and not just as glamorous woman so I moved up to Seattle I had a Wonder
mix82_separation_2|I knew that the guy who saved him was this wonderful Maverick Australian speech therapist of failed Shakespearean actor not even a doctor and it's that is that combination that so extraordinary and the excitement of that would know
mix83_separation_1|hey buddy yes if it is a big hit when the president United States
mix83_separation_2|he's on paper but I just know that and I thought it directly tell him
mix84_separation_1|I like to create I guess I'm very creative person and I have a lot of fun doing different
mix84_separation_2|
mix85_separation_1|that of course for camera gear you'll and then kind of way on Craigslist yeah your voice
mix85_separation_2|you know Innovation is your terminal your voice incongruity could give her your books
mix86_separation_1|you wanted to give the money back couldn't find it the way to do it and what is open what just open his mind is when he had this
mix86_separation_2|for 20 seconds write me the amount of time but that's awkward as maybe during the ordering then when the food first purpose of the conversation
mix87_separation_1|rolling in Timber and Civil War to be fair I was voice and and there was a lot of Civil War and very little link I would have wept out there
mix87_separation_2|if you're going to do it do it I mean yes step off this is diving voice if you know if you sink to the bottom rise up and get out
mix88_separation_1|- flight there a couple days feeds off I'm really excited about that
mix88_separation_2|I did that for seven years I've kind of earned a lot next year you gotta give them the shape that's kind of his foot the bill
mix89_separation_1|the humor in The Parlor I play comes out of his
mix89_separation_2|we're original Chris and myself that I pray they're all over the house whose stories
mix90_separation_1|no look at her jokes and exciting but at the same time heat about it was to bring up some really interesting stuff pocket
mix90_separation_2|22 like 30 but she riding leave that open God brought about a back story as her character and some I was the rudest overspend
mix91_separation_1|NBA caliber music straight sin might be absence trade-offs that he's not Michael Jordan your message
mix91_separation_2|you know it's absolutely terrified about Filippo so this I've read so much about her at that stage and she's just such
mix92_separation_1|this version following in the footsteps of great laughter that's because this is positively about someone scream that's used to already humanize the kind of like that you
mix92_separation_2|you know I'm Steven I figure you've 2000 people kind of right there with you screaming hollering yeah they're speaking in front of him
mix93_separation_1|there are two kind of personality you should have because of the person's because the public that I made of baseballs challenge
mix93_separation_2|I don't know I just don't think so no thanks anyway okay so we can get it in with now couple weeks goes by another sketch gets thrown out
mix94_separation_1|as in classical and Audrina gospel in your single Orleans and all of those different types of music you would she would go into one world and sort of crazy other ones
mix94_separation_2|I'm not sure there's anything new to say you can have a new angle with this knowing new information information was there was this new information
mix95_separation_1|if you can give yourself permission to not be afraid you know cuz you only get one round of it
mix95_separation_2|I have a thing where I get really nervous when they give you a hard copy paper cuz I'm like just give me email it to me
mix96_separation_1|very very excited it's just now kind of we're just now turned really depressing
mix96_separation_2|shooting on Monday I think we'll Royal Scandal which you'll be playing the Prince of Wales
mix97_separation_1|to 2D or even amazing Pixar Animation out everything is real
mix97_separation_2|it's the perfect moment for that over your shoulder I someone I know at
mix98_separation_1|them sometimes you know and and the thing is Captain Flint is one of those characters where you you're intrigued by him he's very enigmatic you like him he's got a charm but at the same time he does terrible things which makes it
mix98_separation_2|DiCaprio's company they had the idea of taking the putting the werewolf back in if it was an old version of it and that added this whole layer of a murderer mix
mix99_separation_1|you ability some of you will be tail Gunners and be Kane section the rest of you will be whatever your language
mix99_separation_2|because it's most important that you keep ownership of your master recording that's what that
mix100_separation_1|I'm going to take 15 yeah I said I said I've got a couple of options here
mix100_separation_2|but suddenly I was so inspired that
mix101_separation_1|and everything gets shot out of order so it's not really feel any different than it was
mix101_separation_2|enough that would dissuade you from it and that that's probably closer to what I had done
mix102_separation_1|in Mascot emblem cassettes in the early 19th century a soy that's never been told so it's a
mix102_separation_2|three or four I would probably pick lie to me my love
mix103_separation_1|special attention to detail was called the great great design but a wonderful writer and for me greater because I was there
mix103_separation_2|a lot of coaches we did so many different locations which is which is kind of evil against the gold program
mix104_separation_1|do you like service it was hard to kind of dissociate or to try to and too
mix104_separation_2|you don't like drama tour if you will on set to make sure that we got it right and if we didn't get it right below
mix105_separation_1|from 15 to 16 Maya the first job I did it was Miracles voice that was on the to the the end Channel it was Noggin
mix105_separation_2|you know if you want to write like my life as a dog or some super classy films that will be remembered forever this is not a book about that this is a book about writing
mix106_separation_1|draw parallels between the future world that we would have been and where we started which is pretty cool
mix106_separation_2|continuty weather is how camera works like I got I got to see so much that I'm I consider myself very lucky just supposed to be you know
mix107_separation_1|it's really unfair that Michigan Ann Arbor I was in Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan we were there all season it's kind of a weird place to because it's a hitch
mix107_separation_2|I think the most successful bands are not ever necessarily the most talented you know that's just unfortunately the way it is it's really fragile
mix108_separation_1|for that it was a brave still I think it's a think it's you know maybe a classic you know maybe something Worthy
mix108_separation_2|I hope it will be a sort of refreshing reminder of the progress that has been made as well as bird of
mix109_separation_1|I do think it's times when you feel passionate about some in our time that all of us I'm sure you have and II have my time to sort of get out ahead of my brain a little bit and by the way
mix109_separation_2|or whatever and I have one of those on people and so when I would become really really popular he would just get a little bit it's like a what do you call it
mix110_separation_1|it's not in any way I want
mix110_separation_2|latest work on my book I think I might
mix111_separation_1|take me home what can I do is look up and see Rising this is when we look at the ready come do now

mix112_separation_1|livings would have the perfect Suburban life great husband great car great job but she gets a phone call Chichi I'm being told by Japanese authorities that
mix112_separation_2|oh yeah that was sent here to it was about configure page loads of mother I'm done yes seems all and most of it wasn't to do with sex
mix113_separation_1|you live in this kind of environment with what person to change Olympia now all the sudden it's like you can't talk about it well we live in
mix113_separation_2|at guns to the house there's nothing but you want to research the character gravity's too rough characters started by having folks according what I want
mix114_separation_1|some and all I was really in the mood to write when I woke up to have
mix114_separation_2|well I'm going to do is like changing my dress won't we had just been shooting in a
mix115_separation_1|I'm not a bad guy but but certainly not not as very squared away guy not a guy who seems to be on any kind of track to success
mix115_separation_2|I finally connected was off the float and I was just traveling and you were in the same room at the same time and I told him that
mix116_separation_1|so it's there's a special place in my heart for the original show and that was part of kind of what you know gravitated me toward wanted to come back and be a part of them
mix116_separation_2|truce many lives that emerge from that session those two sessions that we had many many years ago and it it affects our relationship today so we
mix117_separation_1|and have it be a joke
mix117_separation_2|all the thoughts that would go through a very ads are going through my head
mix118_separation_1|unhappy manager of those ill-starred meds in the beginning of their existence use this tag are to vent his frustrations at the ineptitude of his
mix118_separation_2|some people need it more than others she would have that list that feels doesn't necessarily need it that doesn't mean it couldn't be
mix119_separation_1|Cox right they do everything and I and what's this
mix119_separation_2|um company way we got here in it and I am used to be exhibited cut the violence
mix120_separation_1|vulnerability in all of us and that compassion and all that
mix120_separation_2|a obviously and at some point he had to go but I think you ask of us
mix121_separation_1|you know the wrap around sideways yeah Jack Black's Thomas I was happy to get that and I don't pray on like white flag

mix122_separation_2|and it changes him for the rest of the saloons and I told I told John I said you know because we shot out of order but we had an order of issue yeah which is nice because we knew exactly where each episode went and he said
mix123_separation_1|one thing led to another and I got my first big gig on E hosting Wild on traveled around

mix124_separation_2|and you know she's days go by and you wait for a phone call and sometimes it's yes sometimes it's mentioned in this case
mix125_separation_1|oh well I support areas well I loved it because it was such a grand kotel from another era
mix125_separation_2|how do you know it's a stupid kind of criticism I think because when I was growing up you know the youngest of 10 children in a very poor I am light
mix126_separation_1|buy a chair with a lot of Chef
mix126_separation_2|so that's kind of cool to me and one of the things that I try to do when I direct
mix127_separation_1|but I felt this inclination sitting with them and sitting with me tea and talking about our characters backstory talking about the back story with band Abel
mix127_separation_2|three some highlights about Paola Suárez as you know she likes George O'Malley and so season 3 be prepared because she's coming up

mix132_separation_2|I said it's just bonding probably with new people and spending time getting to know them and you know getting into character getting to to create someone
mix133_separation_1|of course and it's quite a responsibility it's such a big character such a famous code that she said that she didn't want to think she didn't want to overthink it and sort of almost go
mix133_separation_2|Lots where you simply can't seat and stuff so it's more repetitive where you repeat the first letter of a word but in my research I was told they were interchangeable
mix134_separation_1|Anders was there and Robert Rodriguez was there and Quentin was there with Reservoir Dogs and we were there within the
mix134_separation_2|and then get some tape one so and just like if you're playing baseball in the minor leagues work your way up you have to offer

mix154_separation_2|yes down the line this is just a very very profound version of that story when Apollo changes in and it's negotiated with such
mix155_separation_1|it's a game where you have to guess what the blues account person
mix155_separation_2|the hotel manager in this hotel which is for people who are single it's sort of a
mix156_separation_1|two girls have had to if they were young kids to conquer their crazy rock and roll times and got the trying to be adult and have
mix156_separation_2|so delighted that everyone returns in the wall and I mean we had to go through that to happen I didn't know if feel they didn't happen
mix157_separation_1|connection so that took a lot of pressure off the rest of it's just been
mix157_separation_2|it's just hard to go through it
mix158_separation_1|hey does he asking for you put on a big mustache all of a sudden
mix158_separation_2|you know some of them have some of our job is very hard work some of our job is not so

mix160_separation_2|ladies your hard work we've got to stop that bad
mix161_separation_1|looking but in a box so I do all this because I'm playing with him and so I might myself
mix161_separation_2|middle / middle-upper class young black women who are my age come up smooth
mix162_separation_1|I'm hot celebrity walking in and every time I would either have my head between my legs or I did you know how that in sweat dripping Justin Timberlake was walking I
mix162_separation_2|when you know when can I'm already have you tried to kiss me and then I kissed him and it's things like my brother and then you know this comes and
mix163_separation_1|if the former cop and every time I see a young black news brother are watching more TV movies
mix163_separation_2|that does two ways of thinking or this two ways of seeing the world and have both of them are a value and that they're actually more
mix164_separation_1|from far I would like to know if I can't talk I love them I end up touching you because if they get sick I have to help her
mix164_separation_2|and that's the cool thing about playing that character is that like no matter where I go out life like I can go to Hip Hop shows or I can go to like you know
mix165_separation_1|if it's lazy what should be like me
mix165_separation_2|move the narrative forward and give the audience is done with the stronger sense of what so Helios
mix166_separation_1|children they look at what you look like they do make a big new your hair a certain way
mix166_separation_2|Sylvia is my circle caring
mix167_separation_1|it's really a faster than just doubling back on what Gary was saying about the education system I want you to remember that
mix167_separation_2|you know you get started very superficial fix looking to actually go and study and read in definitely about it was quite revealing
mix168_separation_1|Galaxy gets here cut Universe get here and so all of our evidence points to a pretty fun beginning of the universe the Big Bang
mix168_separation_2|weird and the whole point is like it is weird but then how do we then it makes total sense they've been through so much together and so there's so much there
mix169_separation_1|then so complimentary of the chemistry that we had and everybody's been very happy to
mix169_separation_2|I would use some color and light in our films at Picsart help to
mix170_separation_1|this will have always loved the Western genre I mean I went through a period when I was like 12 years old ride just like read every new wheel the more ever written
mix170_separation_2|how it affected me and I got in the back of a taxi and I thought oh my goodness I don't like and oh yeah oh dear and then we are I ruined my hand
mix171_separation_1|I just kind of I mean I taught myself so originally but that I did go to school for multimedia production and graphic design so they helped me perfect
mix171_separation_2|figures and I just did such a good way of getting see it also if you like the British character the very good way of seeing it up close that's weird creatures under the stones of
mix172_separation_1|yeah I just I'm just aware wanting to you know at some point you take care of these take care of the germs every both you out every three hours
mix172_separation_2|and wine and roses with almost fell because the first few were comedies and they work boom maybe script can
mix173_separation_1|and my whole body it felt like a big broad can eat it before medicine Subway isn't it felt
mix173_separation_2|I agree with you so we're going to do
mix174_separation_1|bye-bye
mix174_separation_2|I bought the macaroni and beef 1 which is this is a copy of that cyst clicks it's the second step maybe go I'm not a normal here I'm not
mix175_separation_1|their first job of almost together and group Garner watch this exchange of ideas and crosstalk and notes can't ask faculty
mix175_separation_2|I really love about iris is that we watched her grow we didn't see her be one character from Steven one and just stay that way we're continuing to see her
mix176_separation_1|I think the audience always like goes not to for Sherry and I love that feeling a live audience responding to that moment in the stage show but also as a
mix176_separation_2|hey in the middle of the night and like try some sex family down here but like that's the only way that he knows how to show that log and I think with Astrid it's with you know calling her pet
mix177_separation_1|no not really not forgot 16 or so I think yeah I didn't really know what it's like
mix177_separation_2|it's just so much fun you get to hang out with your friends especially during the road shows like Lily like really bad
mix178_separation_1|is what you mentioned did not turn out to be the truth because I feel like we're a lot
mix178_separation_2|make it to work on time because your train is always being blasted by a super villain my
mix179_separation_1|yes he's that was six because we only had two things together and I was so nervous by the time we shot that it was right near the end
mix179_separation_2|here's a nurse is one day I want to get out there a lot of people are like oh you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for your father that's how I supposed to be no I'm working hard so my kids will have to go through what I have to go through
mix180_separation_1|a little bit faking off their game next to him but I think one of the great things about the story is that by the time the movie
mix180_separation_2|it was an absolute honor to portray him and Band of Brothers and that's an understatement Spock never likes being called a hero but that's
mix181_separation_1|check and they have a very strong track actor that I finally won always lifelong and I'm slavik and I moved it
mix181_separation_2|and Sid has taken it upon himself to take the relationship to the next level even though they're really not at a level to begin with and it
mix182_separation_1|we really are so you know a lot of nuances in this complex relationship no way that I did
mix182_separation_2|it had the kind of cumulative in fact I've always thought the piece kind of a mix of what happened do you handle this without telling me
mix183_separation_1|Chicago Tribune editorial board allowed it to go into prep so
mix183_separation_2|we had no idea what we're at night because we're just making a small film forcing people to enjoy life
mix184_separation_1|living in the world so it's very important
mix184_separation_2|
mix185_separation_1|nothing successful in school work unfortunately
mix185_separation_2|and seven-day 14 to give me another lap dance
mix186_separation_1|New Kids on the Block on the wall and we couldn't get the like do things or they wouldn't you know they wouldn't even to life before
mix186_separation_2|why people are cast what really goes on when the cameras aren't there so because that's this pretty much the number one question I get is what
mix187_separation_1|who have become War Machine mentality you know and all of this stuff needs to learn a lesson I'm at right now
mix187_separation_2|another easy kind of what to do with menstruating women I move a those with him down there I would think to myself if that's not required or
mix188_separation_1|tarragon radio has what what she's doing much better with us and I have my rules when it comes
mix188_separation_2|anybody 0 people that I follow people are like your arrogance prick like I get really
mix189_separation_1|extraordinary patience because anybody else for the Vets it's well as of an art of abandoned was was due to develop very well
mix189_separation_2|about a gay couple who have two kids decide they want to find their biological father so it's a really
mix190_separation_1|sometimes you buy from a scalper you get there there's already some running shoes so the way to do that hey be transparent with you could let him know no it's
mix190_separation_2|you know I took a lot of inspiration bare hands already because he retained the rights to show like you know a lot of videos were released that love it he out of there
mix191_separation_1|that's what I want to do and my mom I was so blessed to be in this family because my my mom always thought the Arts was a noble profession and show so I went to
mix191_separation_2|goes to 25,000 and that's I mean all I did was put up a page right it just speaks to the tens of thousands of people who felt the same way I did and then let's help some refugees

mix194_separation_2|and in China it even goes all the way back to folks all right yeah when ancient literature is so so well from the Western audience is a little bit more unusual and
mix195_separation_1|the Titanic must go down then I will go down
mix195_separation_2|she would be all in that same group especially if they've done a couple of films before
mix196_separation_1|there's more there's more that I can't remember I really I love television I like long forms
