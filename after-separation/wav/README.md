This directory contains all of the speech file pairs.  Each speech file comes
as a pair.  The transcription of each of these speech file pairs are stored
in in the ../amazon and ../google subdirectories.

This directory contains the speech file pairs after mixing them, and then
separating the mix into individual speech file pairs.
